Explanation:
I completed my project on my own. I will explain everything in my house. 

Description:
I created a big living room. I added a big TV, a sofa, several tables and three chairs to my living room and one chair is textured with the fire. In addition, I added a book shelf and put two books onto the book shelf. I also added a basketball onto the ground, I added a bottle of milk, a floated box on one table and a cup next to the bottle. I also added a cake to another table and a plate next to the cake. I put a laptop and an iPhone on the third table. In addition, I put a duck on the ground and put the TV remote in the sofa. What is more, I installed the light-switch in the wall. I give the user the control over the lighting by clicking the light switch.
